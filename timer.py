'''
Create a Time class and initialize it with hours and minutes.
1. Make a method addTime which should take two time object and add them. E.g.- (2 hour and 50 min)+(1 hr and 20 min) is (4 hr and 10 min)
2. Make a method displayTime which should print the time.
3. Make a method DisplayMinute which should display the total minutes in the Time. E.g.- (1 hr 2 min) should display 62 minute.
